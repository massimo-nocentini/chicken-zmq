\title{ØMQ - The Guide, revisited.}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
ZeroMQ (also known as ØMQ, 0MQ, or zmq) looks like an embeddable networking
library but acts like a concurrency framework. It gives you sockets that carry
atomic messages across various transports like in-process, inter-process, TCP,
and multicast. You can connect sockets N-to-N with patterns like fan-out,
pub-sub, task distribution, and request-reply. It's fast enough to be the
fabric for clustered products. Its asynchronous I/O model gives you scalable
multicore applications, built as asynchronous message-processing tasks. It has
a score of language APIs and runs on most operating systems. ZeroMQ is from
iMatix\footnote{\url{http://www.imatix.com/}} and is LGPLv3 open source.

\mycontent{Our contribution to the official guide \citep{Hintjens:guide} consists in
providing an incomplete set of bindings for Chicken scheme by a minimal and
straightforward translation.}
\end{abstract}

\section*{How It Began}

We took a normal TCP socket, injected it with a mix of radioactive isotopes
stolen from a secret Soviet atomic research project, bombarded it with 1950-era
cosmic rays, and put it into the hands of a drug-addled comic book author with
a badly-disguised fetish for bulging muscles clad in spandex. Yes, ZeroMQ
sockets are the world-saving superheroes of the networking world.

\section*{The Zen of Zero}

The Ø in ZeroMQ is all about tradeoffs. On the one hand this strange name
lowers ZeroMQ's visibility on Google and Twitter. On the other hand it annoys
the heck out of some Danish folk who write us things like "ØMG røtfl", and "Ø
is not a funny looking zero!" and "Rødgrød med fløde!", which is apparently an
insult that means "may your neighbours be the direct descendants of Grendel!"
Seems like a fair trade.

Originally the zero in ZeroMQ was meant as "zero broker" and (as close to)
"zero latency" (as possible). Since then, it has come to encompass different
goals: zero administration, zero cost, zero waste. More generally, "zero"
refers to the culture of minimalism that permeates the project. We add power by
removing complexity rather than by exposing new
functionality.
